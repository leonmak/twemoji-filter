# Get a subset of twemojis by categories

From my blog post: [Twemojis for React & Mapbox gl](http://leonmak.me/Twemojis-for-React-Mapbox-gl) 

Due to Mapbox studio's 500 sprite upload limit, I had to choose a subset of [twemojis](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) to upload to use with [react-emoji-picker](https://github.com/chadoh/react-emoji-picker)

# Usage
To get the emojis from the people and objects category:

```sh
npm i
node my-script.js
```

Select emojis you want in `emoji-name-category.js` or comment out those you don't want.

Files are in the `out` folder
